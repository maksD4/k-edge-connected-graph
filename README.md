# Finding the minimum k-edge-connected spanning supgraph of G

## Problem description
The problem is about finding minimal k-edge-connected spanning supgraph of graph G (*connected graph is k-edge-connected if it remains connected whenever fewer than k edges are removed.*).

### Implemented algorithms
In this repository, there are implemented two types of algorithms to solve this problem: greedy algorithm and dynamic algorithm. The greedy algorithm is fast with a chance of finding minimal k-edge-connected graph, while the dynamic algorithm always find the best solution of the problem at the expense of time.

## Model

### Input data
$`\ G = (V,E) `$ - input graph  
$`\ k \geq 1 `$ - integer  
### Variables
$`\ x_e \in \{0, 1\}, \forall e \in E`$, where  
$`\  x_e = 1:`$ when $`\ e \in E'`$  
$`\  x_e = 0:`$ when $`\ e \notin E'`$  
### Objective function
Minimization of supgraph edges:  
$`\ f = \sum_{e \in E} x_e `$
### Limitations
  - Subgraph $`\ H = (V_H, E_H)`$, where $`\ V_H = V`$  and $`\ E_H = \{e \in E:x_e = 1 \}`$  
  - $`\ \forall v \in V_H `$  $`\ deg(v) \ge k `$
  - $`\ (H' = (V_H, E_H \setminus X) `$ $`\ \land `$ $`\ \forall{|X| < k} `$ $`\ X \subseteq E_H) \to `$ graph H is k-edge-connected

## Visualization of results

## Visualization of dynamic algorithm search
As an example, we will use a graph generated by the gnp generator from the networkx library with parameters $`\ n=6 `$ $`\ p=0.65 `$ $`\ k=2 `$

The algorithm starts with the vertex with the highest degree. It checks all possible edges to remove, ensuring that the set of such edges has not already been checked and that the graph is still **k**-edge-consistent after removing them. The following graph shows the contents of the list 'edges_queue' and illustrates the algorithm.
