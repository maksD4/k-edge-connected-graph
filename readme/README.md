# Finding the minimum k-edge-connected spanning supgraph of G

## Problem description
The problem is about finding minimal k-edge-connected spanning supgraph of graph G (*connected graph is k-edge-connected if it remains connected whenever fewer than k edges are removed.*).

### Implemented algorithms
In this repository, there are implemented two types of algorithms to solve this problem: greedy algorithm and dynamic algorithm. The greedy algorithm is fast with a chance of finding minimal k-edge-connected graph, while the dynamic algorithm always find the best solution of the problem at the expense of time.

## Model

### Input data
$`\ G = (V,E) `$ - input graph  
$`\ k \geq 1 `$ - integer  
### Variables
$`\ x_e \in \{0, 1\}, \forall e \in E`$, where  
$`\  x_e = 1:`$ when $`\ e \in E'`$  
$`\  x_e = 0:`$ when $`\ e \notin E'`$  
### Objective function
Minimization of supgraph edges:  
$`\ f = \sum_{e \in E} x_e `$
### Limitations
  - Subgraph $`\ H = (V_H, E_H)`$, where $`\ V_H = V`$  and $`\ E_H = \{e \in E:x_e = 1 \}`$  
  - $`\ \forall v \in V_H `$  $`\ deg(v) \ge k `$
  - $`\ (H' = (V_H, E_H \setminus X) `$ $`\ \land `$ $`\ \forall{|X| < k} `$ $`\ X \subseteq E_H) \to `$ graph H is k-edge-connected

## Visualization of results
Solution of the greedy algorithm and the cipher for the graph generated by the gnp_random_graph algorithm from the networkx libraries with 8 vertices and an edge modulus probability of 75%.
